# An EmptyEpsilon terminal

Run Lua code via the [exec.lua endpoint](https://github.com/daid/EmptyEpsilon/wiki/HTTP-Server) of EmptyEpsilon's HTTP API as if it were a basic, mostly broken terminal. Just a minimal wrapper of jQuery Terminal around POSTs to the endpoint.

Accepts basic keyboard commands common to [jQuery Terminals](https://terminal.jcubic.pl/api_reference.php#shortcuts), including command history via <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>.
